# powerd
Caffeinate in disguise

Basically the equivalent to caffeinate -s -i -d, but without having to specify cmd line args and with conspicuous Power Management assertion strings. Make it difficult to spot with ps or pmset. For best results, use pyinstaller to generate a standalone binary called powerd.
